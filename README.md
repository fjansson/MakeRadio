# Sketches for Make:Radio

by Fredrik Jansson and Charles Platt.

These sketches are for the Raspberry Pi Pico and need to be uploaded with the Arduino IDE.

Every sketch is stored in its own directory, named according to the experiment where it is used. Note that before you can use the sketches, several setup steps are required. These are described in Experiment 4.


You can use the sketches in two ways:

* view the files directly on GitHub by clicking the directory and then the sketch file within it. Copy and paste the code into your Arduino IDE.

* download a zip file with all the sketches [here](https://github.com/fjansson/MakeRadio/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
